<p>My name is Jody Hamilton.  I write songs etc.</p>
<p>This site shows and plays you digitized things I make.  Pretty much anything flat
 I will show you.  For example, if I made an ashtray out of an old can, I would not show you.
 I might show a picture, but you won't be able to use it very well.</p>
<p>I also have a site called <a href="http://riflenice.com" target="_parent">RifleNice.com</a>
 on which you can hear more evolved versions of many songs performed along with my 
 best buddies.</p>
 <p>In other words, this site exists purely for vanity.</p>
 <p>You can also digitally befriend me at <a href="http://myspace.com/flatjody" 
 target="_parent">Myspace.com/Flatjody</a></p>
